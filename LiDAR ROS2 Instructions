To start the lidar sensor in ROS:
1. Open up a new terminal window
2. type the command "ros2 launch sllidar_ros2 sllidar_a1_launch.py" (without the quotation marks)
(you could use "ros2 launch sllidar_ros2 view_sllidar_a1_launch.py" if you want the visualization of the LiDAR sensor)
3. If you type "ros2 topic list" you should see "/scan" as a topic
4. If you type "rqt", you should see a node with /sllidar_node with an arrow to the /scan topic

For the A2M8
ros2 launch sllidar_ros2 view_sllidar_a2m8_launch.py - for the viewer
ros2 launch sllidar_ros2 sllidar_a2m8_launch.py - for just the topic

For Mid-360
ros2 launch livox_ros_driver2 rviz_MID360_launch.py - for viz
ros2 launch livox_ros_driver2 msg_MID360_launch.py - for msg

Config
Need to edit config file (or the file before it builds in src):
/ros2_ws/install/livox_ros_driver2/share/livox_ros_driver2/config/MID360_config.json
/ws_livox/config

Can also edit config files to change parameters
/ros2_ws/install/livox_ros_driver2/share/livox_ros_driver2/launch_ROS2/
